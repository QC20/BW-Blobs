# Circle Shader Visualization

This repository showcases a WebGL implementation of a mesmerizing circle visualization using shaders. The project dynamically renders circles that pulsate and move across the screen based on procedural noise and time-based animations.

## Features

- **WebGL Visualization**: Utilizes WebGL for high-performance graphics rendering directly in the browser.
- **Dynamic Circle Animation**: Circles pulsate and move based on procedural noise and time variables, creating an interactive visual experience.
- **Shader Programming**: Implements both vertex and fragment shaders to achieve the desired visual effects.
- **Responsive Canvas**: The visualization adjusts to fit various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Usage

To explore the visualization:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a WebGL-compatible browser.
3. Experience the dynamic circle animation powered by shaders and procedural noise.

## Technologies Used
